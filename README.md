# ML-twitchFix
A repo that is a centre where you can find advanced code on Machine Learning that helps fix any glitches found in patients in a hospital or healthcare facility. It contains everything from code on Neural Networks to Artificial Intelligence targeted towards the healthcare sector. The aim of this project is to create a program that autocorrects itself into completing the goals that we program it to achieve.
